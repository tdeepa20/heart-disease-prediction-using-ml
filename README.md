                        Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

Heart disease is one of the leading health concerns worldwide, and early detection can help reduce risks and save lives.  
This project uses **Machine Learning algorithms** to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient medical features.  

## Project Workflow
1. Import dataset  
2. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding, outlier detection, etc.)  
3. Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
4. Model evaluation


## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Naive Bayes  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost  
- Neural Network  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  

---

## Insights
- Logistic Regression gave the best accuracy in this dataset(88.52%).
